# Genetic Algorithm Report for Basics of Computer Simulation


## Description 
Genetic Algorithm to find roots of equation with 4 variables
**2x+3y+5z+4q=20**
---
Roots of an equation are in the range of [0;20]
---
We take 5 random values of a,b,c,d
---
We have 5 randomed generations
1. (22,12,11,7)
2. (8,29,12,1)
3. (12,26,4,15)
4. (3,9,10,23)
5. (13,17,26,6) 
---
Then we have to calculate the fittness coefficient by calculating distance from needed value to 20.
---
The nearest values to 20 are more desired.
---
Next, we will choose five pairs of parents, who will have exactly one child. We will give the will to the case exactly five times, each time the chance to become a parent will be the same and will equal the chance of survival. (We use "crossover" here)

---

## Pseudocode

```python
FOR each C do{
	find start node
	REPEAT
		FOR (i=0; i < (N)/2; i++) {
			select five parents from population
			generate five offsprings by crossover operation between two parent
			insert five offsprings to the new generation
			if (new_offspring satisfy the coverage) {
				add offsping to new population
				break
			}
		}
		mutate some offsprings in new generation list
	do until satisfy
}
```
